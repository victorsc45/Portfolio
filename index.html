            I am a web developer I have knowledge from many different areas of technology, and I have had a commitment to
            learning new technologies. I have a Computer Science degree, Bachelor of Science degree, and an MBA with an emphasis
            in Information Technology. I am comfortable in fast paced environments with the organizational skills honed as an
            entrepreneur. Web Development is my current path and role that I am seeking.

        <p>
            I am comfortable in high-volume, customer-focused environments, and solving issues that are real-time event driven.
            I have more than ten years of experience as owner and operator of incorporated business. What do I bring to the
            table? Business experience in customer facing environments. Years of knowledge understanding and developing customer
            relationships.
